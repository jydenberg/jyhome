My Personal and Portfolio Webpage

Created as a Static Generated site using Hugo.IO, an open source static site creation tool. It integrates with a variety of programming languages, uses the extremely optimized Forestry content management system that integrates directly with Github and makes use of Golang's Go programming language and syntax. I highly recommend it for anyone with basic programming language understanding and some amount of source version control experiend.

My favorite part was that it allows you to use HTML, CSS, and JS as per usual, but also gives you more CSS options, variables, and other things that come with golang. It is highly optimized, low overhead, and is an excellent tool for anyone interested in static webpage development.
