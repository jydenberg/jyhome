### Mission Statement
I seek to use my creativity, passion, technical ability and experience working within and leading teams to provide the best solutions possible. I evolve and discover consistantly, continue to seek new challenges, and have a desire to become the best version of myself. This philosophy has always been core to who I am, and having completed my degree i am now applying this to the persuit of a career in software development.


### Who am I?

I was born and raised in Vancouver, BC - a city which i continue to love after many years. I traveled extensively all over the globe, and have been involved in many jobs including working within, managing and owning a variety of construction businesses. But even with some success, i felt that something was lacking. After considering the options, i realized a career change was in order. I decided to take my interest and passion for computers and video games and take a new Career path towards the tech sector. I went back to University, where i was quickly drawn to the mix of knowledge, logic, and creativity that coding requires.
