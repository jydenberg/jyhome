### Mission Statement
I seek to use my creativity, passion, technical ability and experience working within and leading teams to provide the best solutions possible. I strive to improve and discover consistently, I continue to seek new challenges, and I have a desire to become the best version of myself. This philosophy has always been core to who I am. Having completed my degree, I am now applying this to the pursuit of a career in software development.

### Who am I?

I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, a city which I continue to love. I have traveled extensively around the globe, and have used my talents in a variety of occupations including working sucessfully within, managing and owning a variety of construction businesses. Yet, I felt that something was lacking. After careful consideration, I realized a career change was in order. I decided to take my interest and passion for computers and video games and embark on a new career challenge in the tech sector. I went back to University, where I was drawn to the mix of knowledge, logic, and creativity that coding requires.
