With the reemergence of static sites as a optimized and lightweight solution for many web development needs, i highly recommend Hugo as a static site generator to any developer comfortable in go and with the usual web stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<ul>
    <li>    
    Uses TravisCI for integration and deployment. Automatically deploys without downtime upon push to REPO.
    </li>
    <li>
    Static site generation done through Hugo.
    </li>
    <li>
    Uses bootstrap for dynamic resizing and components
    </li>
</ul>
